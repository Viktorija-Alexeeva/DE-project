# DE-project
Final project has been created during Data Engineering Zoomcamp. 

Project is based on data from Inside Airbnb, which is a mission driven project that provides data and advocacy about Airbnb's impact on residential communities.
It works towards a vision where communities are empowered with data and information to understand, decide and control the role of renting residential homes to tourists.
